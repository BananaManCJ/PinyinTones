Building PinyinTones
=====================

There are two parallel build environments for PinyinTones.

During development, build the solution directly in Visual Studio.  This
will create a dependency on the current version of the Visual C++
runtime.  Binaries will be created under bin\dev.

Release builds depend on the Windows Driver Kit, which links against the
system copy of msvcrt.dll.  This allows the text service to be installed
without any additional prerequisites.  The WDK is recommended for text
services in this TSF team blog post:

Install the following prerequisites:
  1. Windows Driver Kit 7.1
     - Only the "Build Environments" are required.
  2. Windows SDK 7.1
     - Only the "Windows Headers and Libraries" are required.
  3. WIX Toolkit 3.7
     - Manually add it to the PATH so that the build script can find it.

The WDK uses an older build chain based on NMAKE.  Open a WDK Vista x64
environment, then run make-release.cmd.  This will produce both the 32-
bit and the 64-bit installers.

Although the NMAKE build chain has been replaced in WDK 8.0, there are
still a lot of Windows 7 machines in the world.
