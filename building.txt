There are two parallel build environments for PinyinTones.

During development, build directly in Visual Studio.  This will create a dependency
on the current Visual C++ runtime.  Binaries will be output under bin\dev.

For release, we must build using the Windows Driver Kit, as recommended by the
TSF team blog post:

The WDK links against the system copy of msvcrt.dll, which allows the text service
to be installed without any additional prerequisites.  WDK uses an older build chain,
based on NMAKE.

Prerequisites:
  1. Windows Driver Kit 7.1
  2. Windows 7 SDK
  3. WIX Toolkit 3.6 -- must manually add to PATH

To produce installers, open a WDK Vista environment, then run make-release.cmd.
